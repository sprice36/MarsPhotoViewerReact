## About MARS Photo Viewer

MARS Photo Viewer is a REACT application to view the photos taken on Mars on any given sol from any of the three rovers, Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit.  

## What is a Sol ? 
<p> The term "sol" is used by planetary astronomers to refer to the duration of a solar day on Mars. A Martian solar day, or "sol", is 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds. However one Martian year is nearly 2 years on Earth.
